    Dance council is a group of motivated students with a passion for dance!  We
    strive to bring a stronger dance presence in the Mackenzie community.
    Organising events that help engage students to show off their dance skills
    such as our holiday TikTok dance event has been a highlight! Dance Council
    is a place where all students can come together and express their shared
    love for the art and we welcome any and all students! Dance is a way for
    students to express themselves in ways that words cannot and we are always
    working on new exciting initiatives such as dance workshops and fun events.
    Through the strong efforts of our entire council, we are constantly working
    on finding new and creative ways and events to help foster the dance spirit
    at Mackenzie!
