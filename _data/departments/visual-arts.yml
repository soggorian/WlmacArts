    Visual Arts Council strives to promote the visual arts that have been
    created by Mackenzies talented students! Despite having remote schooling for
    most of the year, Visual Arts Council was still able to create events for
    all of MAC to enjoy! This year we had The Monthly Theme Artwork Submissions,
    Valentines Themed Food Week, Paint Night during Arts in Bloom and our year
    long mural project. We would love to hear from you if you have any
    questions, concerns, comments, cat pictures or just to chat!
