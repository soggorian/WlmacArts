    Music Council is a group of students that represent the music department of
    Mackenzie, comprising club presidents, section leaders, fundraisers,
    librarians, and communications representatives. We help organize shows and
    coordinate our ensembles and other initiatives. We have many ensembles you
    can join. For beginner students, we welcome you to the Junior Band and Choir
    and for our more experienced players, you are welcome to the Wind Symphony,
    Jazz Band, Choir, String Ensemble, and Junior Winds. Let’s make music and
    come together.
