    Music Council is a group of students that represent the music department of
    Mackenzie. We help organize shows and help coordinate our ensembles and
    other initiatives. This year we ran virtual performances and rehearsals as
    well as mentorship programs for our junior students. We have many ensembles
    you can join. For beginner students we welcome you to the Junior Band and
    Choir and for our more experienced players you are welcome to the Wind
    Ensemble, Jazz Band, Choir and to our Klezmer Band by invitation. Letâ€™s make
    music and come together.
