    Drama council is a team of Mackenzie students with a passion for performance
    and a flair for the dramatic. Drama council handles all drama related events
    at Mackenzie, and lets anyone get involved in productions— even if they
    don’t want to be on stage! This year, drama council produced Mackenzie’s
    first ever virtual play: Much Ado About Zoom Class, a student written and
    run production that premiered on youtube to over 1000 viewers! Drama council
    handled everything behind the scenes, working on editing, props, costumes,
    graphics, and more! If you love theatre and want to be a part of future
    productions in any capacity, drama council is the place for you. Come and
    join us to put on plays and find your theatre family!
