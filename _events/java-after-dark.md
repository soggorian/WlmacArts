At Java After Dark, Mackenzie’s celebrates the arts. Students are given the opportunity to express their artistic talents through monologues, videos, photography installations, and musical performances. The Arts department sets up a stage in the library and family and friends of the student performers are invited to come and view the show. Audience members are also provided with snacks, coffee, and other foods to nibble on during intermission. It’s a wonderful way to see what Mackenzie has to offer.
